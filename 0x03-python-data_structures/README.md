## About
In this project, I dive deeper into `Python`, by solving tasks relating to `import` and `modules`.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Requirements
##### Python Scripts
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
##### C
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Code Style**: Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global Variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables
- **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Sample `main.c` Files**: In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- **Prototypes in Header File**: The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- **Header File Submission**: Don’t forget to push your header file
- **Include Guard**: All your header files should be include guarded
