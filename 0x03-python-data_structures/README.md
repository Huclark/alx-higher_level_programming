## About
Here, I learn about Data Structures (Lists & Tuples) in Python.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python Programming is Awesome
- What are Lists and How to Use Them
- Differences and Similarities Between Strings and Lists
- Common Methods of Lists and How to Use Them
- Using Lists as Stacks and Queues
- What are List Comprehensions and How to Use Them
- What are Tuples and How to Use Them
- When to Use Tuples Versus Lists
- What is a Sequence
- Tuple Packing
- Sequence Unpacking
- The `del` Statement and How to Use It

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
### C
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Code Style**: Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global Variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables
- **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Sample `main.c` Files**: In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- **Prototypes in Header File**: The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- **Header File Submission**: Don’t forget to push your header file
- **Include Guard**: All your header files should be include guarded
