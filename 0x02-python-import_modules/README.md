## About
In this project, I dive deeper into `Python`, by solving tasks relating to `import` and `modules`.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
