## About
I dive deeper into python classes by learning the implementation of inheritance.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is `JSON`
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a `JSON` string
- How to convert a `JSON` string to a Python data structure
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Test Files**: All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- **Test Files Extension**: All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- **Running Tests**: All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation for Modules**: All your modules should have documentation. Use the following command to check documentation for a module: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- **Documentation for Functions (Inside and Outside a Class)**: All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation. Use the following commands to check documentation for a function: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- **Documentation Standards**: A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified. <br> Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
