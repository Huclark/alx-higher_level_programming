## About
I learn about Classes and Objects in Python and how to implement them.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python Programming is Awesome
- What is OOP
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- **Documentation for Modules**: All your modules should have documentation. Use the following command to check documentation for a module: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- **Documentation for Classes**: All your classes should have documentation. Use the following command to check documentation for a class: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- **Documentation for Functions (Inside and Outside a Class)**: All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation. Use the following commands to check documentation for a function: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- **Documentation Standards**: A documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified.

***These guidelines ensure that your code is well-documented at various levels (modules, classes, and functions) and emphasize the importance of meaningful and explanatory documentation. Please make sure to adhere to these standards to maintain code quality and clarity.***
