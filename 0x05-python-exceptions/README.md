## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python Programming is Awesome
- What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
- What are exceptions and how to use them
- When do we need to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a builtin exception
- When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
