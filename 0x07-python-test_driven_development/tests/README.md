# Test Cases
![](https://github.com/Huclark/memes/blob/main/fixing%20bugs.jpg?raw=true)

In as much as deleting the whole program is perhaps, the quickest and easiest way to get rid of bugs, I don't think it is anywhere close to being the best way to get rid of bugs ðŸ˜”.<br>
Since I have to do it the right way, I have carried out unit tests for all functions written in this project and included all test files to the functions in this directory.<br>
Below are all test files and their purposes:

| Test File | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `0-add_integer.txt` | Tests the `add_integer()` function |
| `2-matrix_divided.txt` | Tests the `matrix_divided()` function |
| `3-say_my_name.txt` | Tests the `say_my_name.py()` function |
| `4-print_square.txt` | Tests the `print_square()` function |
| `5-text_indentation.txt` | Tests the `text_indentation()` function |
| `6-max_integer_test.py`  | Tests the `6-max_integer()` function  |
