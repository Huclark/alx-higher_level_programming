In as much as deleting the whole program is perhaps, the quickest and easiest way to get rid of bugs, I don't think it is anywhere close to being the best way to get rid of bugs ðŸ˜”.<br>
Since I have to do it the right way, I have included all test files to the python functions in this directory.<br>
Below are all test files and their purposes:

| Test File | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `0-add_integer.txt` | Tests the `add_integer()` function |
