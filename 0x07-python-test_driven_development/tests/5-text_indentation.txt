5-text_indentation.txt
=======================

This module defines the function, ``text_indentation(text)``, which 
prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ".", "?" and ":"

Usage
=====

Two new lines are printed after each of the characters: ".", "?" and ":"
No spaces are printed at the beginning or end of each line.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("   My thoughts:     Will this work?      Surely, it has to.   ")
    My thoughts:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Will this work?
    <BLANKLINE>
    Surely, it has to.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

When a new line character is present within the text, the function prints
the newline and prints the next line without any spaces at the beginning or end
of the line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("\n\n\n\n   I am so stressed! \n But I actually enjoy coding, you know?\n\n Wait: 'I am actually kidding, sigh'\n Or maybe not. \n   ")
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    I am so stressed!
    But I actually enjoy coding, you know?
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Wait:
    <BLANKLINE>
    'I am actually kidding, sigh'
    Or maybe not.
