## About
I can't believe I have gotten this far in learning Python. It's really amazing. So for this project, I am going to review everything I have learnt about python so far and also learn about the implementation of `args` and `kwargs`.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- **Documentation for Modules**: All your modules should have documentation. Use the following command to check documentation for a module: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- **Documentation for Functions (Inside and Outside a Class)**: All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation. Use the following commands to check documentation for a function: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- **Documentation Standards**: A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified.

### Python Unit Tests
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Test Files**: All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- **Test Module**: You have to use the `unittest module`
- **Test Files Extension**: All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
- **Naming Requirement**: All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- **File Organization**: Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- **Running Tests**: All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
