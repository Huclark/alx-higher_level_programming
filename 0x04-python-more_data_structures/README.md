## About
Diving deeper into Data Structures in Python by covering Sets and Dictionaries.

## Objectives
At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python Programming is Awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are Dictionaries and How to Use Them
- When to Use Dictionaries Versus Lists or Sets
- What is a Key in a Dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Shebang Line Requirement**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length Testing**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- **Modules**: You are not allowed to import any module unless specified otherwise in a task.
